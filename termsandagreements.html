                    <li>Getting automatic notifications confirming our receipt of your orders doesn’t mean the orders would be delivered as your orders are subject to availability, delivery capacity and our acceptance.</li>

Our couriers reserve the right to refuse delivery for reasons including users intoxicated to an extent, specific locations and safety reasons.</li>
                    <li>You will be notified when your order has been delivered.</li>
                    <li>Our delivery staff would leave without delivering your order if they are unable to locate users or if users take a long time to collect the orders. Bartender would determine the fee to be charged to deliver such orders again and a fee to be deducted from any refund as a result.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3><b>Limitation of Liability:</b></h3>
